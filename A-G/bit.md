# Bit manipulation

## Bitwise OR Operator (a|b)

### Conditions:-

- At least one value neeeds to be 1, then it gives value =1;
- If both a and b are zero, then value will be zero.

## let us see example:-

### console.log(14|13)

##### output = 15

- compiler converts it into a binary number and then calculate the value
- and the return us the decimal of the corresponding value.
- in this case binary of 14 is 1110 and 13 is 1101.
- summation of both using bitwise OR operator gives = 1111.

- so the decimal of "1111" is 15.

## Bitwise AND Operator (a&b)

### Conditions:-

- If both a and b are one, then only it will give one as result.
- else in all cases it will give result as zero;

## Let us see example:-

### console.log(14|13)// 12;

- compiler converts it into a binary number and then calculate the value
- and the return us the decimal of the corresponding value.
- in this case binary of 14 is 1110 and 13 is 1101.
- summation of both using bitwise OR operator gives = 1100.

- so the decimal of "1100" is 12.
